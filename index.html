<section class="purpose">
<h1>The Purpose</h1>
<p>Our purpose is simple. We want to prove to teens everywhere that mental wellness isn't some cringe, other world fantasy, but a real step that one can take forward to build a happy life. Many may not even realize it, but they are more vulnerable to poor mental health than their predecessors. Winell is here to change that.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="purpose-col">
    <img src="images/picture3.jpg">
    <h3>Serenity</h3>
    <p>You can't control everything in life. That's how life works. Sometimes, you just have to take a deep breath and let go of what you can't change.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="purpose-col">
    <img src="images/picture.jpg">
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>It's okay to think about yourself sometimes. Reflect on your thoughts, your actions, your wants, and your needs. You don't have to be perfect, and you don't have to be alone in this journey.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="purpose-col">
    <img src="images/picture4.jpg">
    <h3>Resilience</h3>
    <p>Every life is like a sin-cos wave, with peaks and valleys. You've got the good days and the bad. But that's the best part, because you know the bad days will eventually pass.</p>
